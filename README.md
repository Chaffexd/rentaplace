# rentaplace
A simple project that shows a template landing page for renting property. 

Attempt at a landing page style to show potential visitors what they can be offered when looking at a site.

I chose to use a image at the background to evoke emotion from visitors, to get that take me away feeling. Followed up with a clean design. The logos at the bottom of the page are there to show that we are a trusted brand, naturally I would insert real logos there for an official landing page.
